# IoTbasedFIREandIRsensor

The project uses a Fire and an IR sensor to detect fire and obstruction and notifies the user with automatic Email and SMS Notifications.
Besides this, two temperature sensors (LM 35) are used to read temperature which is later plotted on the user interface with Google Chart Visualization tools
This also includes a remote control feature on the UI to control four high voltage switches, this is done using relays
